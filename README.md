TSBS - Theolized Sideview Battle System v1.3
====
An animated sideview battle system for RPG Maker VXAce. This is my first battle system script and my masterpiece script so far. At first, I made this script for my own personal use. Back then when Ace was released, I always wanted an English version of Tankentai. But I heard nothing about the translation. I though it was impossible tankentai to be translated to English. Moreover, it has bad compatibility to other scripts. Then I looked at avalaible battle scripts, and not even a single script I like. I just don't get the idea of those scripts. Then, hence my ambition started. 

This script was greatly inspired from Tankentai VX version and Eremidia : Dungeon! game. It's mainly aimed for free sequence animated battle without standard. I mean, there is no such a thing like "play all frames in row x" (the reason why I did this is because I hate standards). You can pick any grid in your spriteset. You can even use unorganized spriteset if you're too lazy to make one. As long as the format is consistent.

These scripts are open source, free, and must be remain free even used for commercial purpose. You may edit these scripts as you want, make addons, etc. However, you're not allowed to take any advantage by editing or making addons for TSBS such as selling addons (for commercial or not) or take any monetary gain by request. As I said before, it must be remain free. 

You may put your name in credit list by editing TSBS. Even it just very minor. However, do not claim the script as yours. Credit must be given to the original author, TheoAllen.

TSBS are also free for commercial projects. However, I expect a free copy of your game if you plan to use. Do not make me to pay your game.
