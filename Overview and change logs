  TSBS - Overview
  These informations are aimed for scripter to ensure compatibility without
  reading too many lines.
  
  Compatibility notes :
  > I greatly changed the damage flow from scene battle by overwriting def
    use_item in Scene_Battle. So, if there is any script that also using that 
    method, it's highly will NOT compatible with this script. Also, I don't
    use invoke_item, instead I make my own invoke item method by adding
    tsbs_invoke_item. So, anybody won't mess with it
  
  > I haven't touch menu or battle HUD. So, if you planned to make your own
    battle HUD, I'm sure it will be compatible.
  
  > I also haven't touch turn order yet. But I haven't tried ATB either. So
    far, it's compatible with Yanfly - Free turn, or Sabakan - Ao no Kiseki
    battle system.
    
  > If you plan to add galv's timed button attack, I'm afraid it will not
    compatible. Since I greatly changed the damage flow.
    
  > I recommend you to use YEA - Battle Engine. If you refuse it, then if you 
    want to make your own damage popup, just make it yourself. I don't want to 
    make one. Instead, I provide built-in damage counter.
    
  > I don't want to hear any complaint about compatibility issues. Since I
    make this script for my personal use at the first time. But, you can
    modify or even make derivate of my works. If only you're capable
  
  Planned added features :
  >> Compatibility test with AEA - Charge Turn Battle
  >> Extended timed-hit features
  >> Transformation state
  >> Grid Battle System?
  
  Special Thanks :
  >> Mithran for Graphical global object ref
  >> Ryuz Andhika (for the first person who used my battle system)
  >> Komozaku Neko (Bug report)
